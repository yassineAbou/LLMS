## 🤖 Horde AI Integration

Horde AI is a powerful, crowdsourced platform that combines a distributed cluster of image and text
generation workers. For more details, visit their [website](https://stablehorde.net/).

To interact with the models provided by Horde AI, the application utilizes the Horde AI REST API.
For more information on how to use this API, please visit
the [API documentation](https://stablehorde.net/api/).

## 📈 Progress

Our development process is divided into three key steps:

#### 1. Prototype with Fake Data 🚧

- Status: 🔜 In Progress
- Building a basic prototype with fake data to test the app's structure and functionality.

#### 2. Connect with Horde AI REST API 🌐

- Status: ⏰ Not Started
- Integrating the app with Horde AI's REST API to enable AI-powered features and data processing.

#### 3. Implement User Authentication 🔒

- Status: ⏰ Not Started
- Securing the app with user authentication to enable personalized features and data.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **User Interface**:
  Uses [Compose multiplatfrom](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/).

- **Layers**: All data handling, business logic, and presentation layers are implemented
  using [kotlin multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/)

- **backend**: The backend is developed using [Ktor framework](https://ktor.io/).
